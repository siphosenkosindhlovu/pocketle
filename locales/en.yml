          It has all started from Sayuri's homework at Harvard Extention School. There is a lot of information in
          the world, but we can't find the information that people look for as intended and Sayuri learned that it
          is the same in the ecommerce world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sayuri started studying algorithms to find a solution, and suddenly the aha moment came to her. After
            consulting with support organizations, the brush-up for the Pocket's business plan </ br> has begun.

          Sayuri met key persons in business as it was all planned by Gods. She wondered whether the brushed-up-idea
          could work in business world. Sayuri found "Kyoto female entrepreneurship award" on internet and sent out
          the application form. Later I received a notification from Kyoto Prefecture that She was certified as a
          Kyoto Women Entrepreneur Support Project (Entrepreneur) in 2018-2019.

            JETRO, Kyoto Sangyo 21, Astem, Kyoto City, and Kyoto Prefecture have offered to support Pocketle. In
            February 2019, Pocketle won the very special prize of the Kyoto Prefecture Women Entrepreneurs Award - the
            Research Park Award.

        We were told it's not possible. We’re glad we didn’t listen...

        Pocketle was born with support and love from a lot of people. At the same time, there were people who told us we
        can't accomplish what we want. We also were crashed by others' pressure but we continued to convince to them
        without being overwhelmed by such their words and actions. As a result? Their attitude has changed and now they
        also support our goals.

      <div class="deck">
        We are changing that by building the world’s first and only ‘purpose search engine in the cloud’: a dream search
        engine filled with so much hopes. Imagine the moment that you find the products, the service and the information
        that you wanted in a secound but settled for <em>the-advertised-useless-products</em> or spent
        <em>days-for-seeking-information</em> instead.

        We want to expand the possibilities of people.
      </h3>
      <div class="deck">
        We are asked what makes Pocketle different from other IT companies? We say that we are very different from them.
        Because they force the possibility of IT without really thinking through what IT may impact the human liveswhile
        pocketle's stance is that people do what they want to do. We strongly believe that it's not IT's job to take
        away people's work, IT should create jobs to expand people's potential. We are confident that our attitude
        toward trying to solve what people can not do with IT should be felt from our services and products...
