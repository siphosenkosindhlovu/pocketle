        Pocketle was born with support and love from a lot of people. At the same time, there were people who told us we
        can't accomplish what we want. We also were crashed by others' pressure but we continued to convince to them
        without being overwhelmed by such their words and actions. As a result? Their attitude has changed and now they
        also support our goals.

        We are changing that by building the world’s first and only ‘purpose search engine in the cloud’: a dream search
        engine filled with so much hopes. Imagine the moment that you find the products, the service and the information
        that you wanted in a secound but settled for <em>the-advertised-useless-products</em> or spent
        <em>days-for-seeking-information</em> instead.

        We are asked what makes Pocketle different from other IT companies? We say that we are very different from them.
        Because they force the possibility of IT without really thinking through what IT may impact the human liveswhile
        pocketle's stance is that people do what they want to do. We strongly believe that it's not IT's job to take
        away people's work, IT should create jobs to expand people's potential. We are confident that our attitude
        toward trying to solve what people can not do with IT should be felt from our services and products...
